# ControlPCFromPhone

This project allows your iphone to control your mouse PC (OSX or linux) over wifi. Visit [ControlPCFromPhoneServer](https://github.com/olieydt/ControlPCFromPhoneServer)
to obtain the server to be run on your PC. Next install the application on your phone ("to be on app store..."), and simply click connect (the PC
and phone must be on the same network).
